# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), an annual programming challenge held every December.
Each year features many puzzles that test algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.

# 📁 Each day includes:
- My personal puzzle input in "puzzle.txt" file
- My solutions in Java language

# 🧠 My Goals for the event:
- Practice clean and efficient coding
-  Explore algorithms and data structures
-  Build a personal archive of puzzle solutions
-  Enjoy the festive challenge!

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute.
